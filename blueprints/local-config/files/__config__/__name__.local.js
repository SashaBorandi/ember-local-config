/* ==================
 * USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
 * ==================
 *
 * If you'd like to make a local change to this file, you need
 * to tell git to ignore any changes to this file. You can do
 * this by running:
 *
 * git update-index --skip-worktree [file-path]
 *
 * If you want to undo the ignore and actually commit changes:
 *
 * git update-index --no-skip-worktree [file-path]
 *
